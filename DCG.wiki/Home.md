### What is DCG?
Dynamic Combat Generator is an Arma 3 mod designed to help mission makers quickly enhance their cooperative scenarios by supplying a collection of easy to use, modular addons. DCG's addons are highly customizable and allow creators to populate their missions with ease.

### How Do I Use DCG?
The latest version of [Community Based Addons](https://forums.bistudio.com/topic/168277-cba-community-base-addons-arma-3/) is required on the **server and client**.

**Server Setup**
- Extract the DCG and CBA zip files to the server's Arma 3 folder
- After extracting the files, @dcg and @cba_a3 should exist in the server's Arma 3 directory
- To configure a mission for DCG, take a quick look at [Setting up a DCG compatible mission](https://github.com/nicholasclark-artist/DCG/wiki/Setting-up-a-DCG-compatible-mission)
