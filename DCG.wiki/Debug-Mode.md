At any time during a mission, calling `[true] call dcg_main_fnc_debug` on the server will enable DCG's debug mode.

*Regardless of debug mode's state, DCG will print information to the server's RPT file to assist in fixing any issues. For more information on RPT files, see [Crash Files](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Crash_Files#Arma_3).*
