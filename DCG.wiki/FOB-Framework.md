### Overview
The Forward Operating Base framework allows players to function tactically on the battlefield. It includes base building using the Zues interface, a player respawn position, integration with DCG's approval addon and more.

### Ownership
Players exist in two categories in relation to the FOB, controllers and requestors. There can only be one controller at any given time and any player can request control of the Forward Operating Base. If there is no FOB controller or the current controller disconnects then a player's request is automatically accepted.

### Approval Influence
Deploying a Forward Operating Base increases the region's approval value if the approval addon is enabled; this affects how players interact with civilians in the area. Fortifying a FOB by building structures and spawning patrols further increases the approval value, so a built base is more beneficial to players.
